## Image Classification Using Machine Learning ##
-- The program uses cifar 10 dataset which is set of 60000 images in 10 categories
-- Epochs are editable according to the processing speed
-- Input the image number to let the machine predict the exact image from the dataset  (Image number = 2149) 
 
## Requirements ##
Python libraries 
  -- Tensorflow
  -- Numpy
  -- Matplotlib
  -- Keras Models
  -- Scipy
  -- Keras

Note : In some conditions the code does not work due to lack of adaption of Tesnorflow in the system 
       in that case install Tensorflow-Gpu to create virtual environment of tensorflow for the system
